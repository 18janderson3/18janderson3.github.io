# Mock Banking App
This app simulates an online banking interface. there are pages for signing up, logging in, viewing different accounts, depositing and widrawing money, transfering money between accounts, and viewing transaction history.

It utilizes the MERN stack with React on the front end, Node.js and express on the backend, and MongoDB for storing data. It uses sessions and password hashing to handle user authentication. It uses MongoDB for storing user data including login info, account information, amounts in the accounts, and transaction history. The frontend will use REST API calls to the backend when it needs data from the database.

I was specifically resposible for setting up the frontend and backend frameworks, working on UI design, and creating unique API routes.

# Speed Card Game
This is a Multiplayer game that recreates the card game called California speed. it can be played between two devices through a web browser. The game is played in realtime and then stores the Highscores in a database.

It utilizes the MERN stack with React on the front end, Node.js and express on the backend, and MongoDB for storing data. It also uses web sockets for real-time user to user communication. The game is played in real time and uses the web sockets to communicate between the backend server and the other player. The player name and high scores are then stored using REST API calls and stored in a MongoDB database. 

I was specifically responsible for creating the unique websockets and developing the game logic.

# Hangman Game
This Hangman game is played by a user in a web browser guessing letters until the word is guessed correctly or the user fails. Upon which the user is redirected to a page detailing high scores for the game.

It utilizes the MERN stack with React on the front end, Node.js and express on the backend, and MongoDB for storing data. The game uses REST API calls to randomly select a word from a MongoDB database and then keep track of user guesses on the backend so that the user cannot cheat using web browser tools. The player name and high scores are then also stored in the MongoDB database.

I was specifically resposible for setting up the frontend and backend frameworks, working on UI design, and creating unique API routes.
