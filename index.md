# Mock Banking App
This app simulates an online banking interface. there are pages for signing up, logging in, viewing different accounts, depositing and widrawing money, transfering money between accounts, and viewing transaction history.

It utilizes the MERN stack with React on the front end, Node.js and express on the backend, and MongoDB for storing data. It uses sessions and password hashing to handle user authentication. It uses MongoDB for storing user data including login info, account information, amounts in the accounts, and transaction history. The frontend will use REST API calls to the backend when it needs data from the database.

I was specifically resposible for setting up the frontend and backend frameworks, working on UI design, and creating unique API routes.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
